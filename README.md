# ghactions-test

This repository is to show GiHub Actions workflow.

Make any changes to the files in the master branch and commit them.

This will trigger the workflow to start. With the YAML file created in the specific directory in the GitHub repo, we can automatically kick off a series of automation steps.If everything is executed successful, a message will be shown in the Telegram account, named, devopsupdates.

After this, hope to look at creating action workflows by myself.

As a word of caution, when inputting or amending string values in the yaml file, be careful of using single or double quotes in the string as this may cause workflow error due to yaml script recognising a pair of quotations as valid.
